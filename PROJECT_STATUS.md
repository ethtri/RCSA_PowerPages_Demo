## 🛠 **Technical Architecture & Lessons Learned**

### **Platform Stack**
- **Platform:** Microsoft Power Pages
- **Frontend:** Bootstrap 5 + Custom RCSA Design System
- **Styling:** `rcsa-styles.css` (critical - DO NOT break link)
- **JavaScript:** Inline for reliable deployment
- **State Management:** localStorage with `assessmentData` object

### **Critical Technical Insights**

#### **1. Power Pages Deployment Considerations**
```bash
# ALWAYS use this exact deployment command
pac powerpages upload --path rcsa-copilot-demo---rcsa-demo --modelVersion 2
```
- **Environment:** rcsa-demo.powerappsportals.com (NOT site-5joks)
- **CSS Link:** Must maintain `<link>` to rcsa-styles.css or dashboard breaks
- **Inline JS:** Preferred over external files for reliability

#### **2. DOM Timing & Defensive Programming**
```javascript
// CRITICAL: Always use try-catch around DOM updates
try {
    updateProgress(stepNumber);
} catch (error) {
    console.warn('Progress update failed:', error);
    // Fallback logic here
}
```
- **Power Pages DOM quirks** require defensive programming
- **Breadcrumb updates** can fail; always provide fallback navigation
- **Dynamic content** needs null checks before manipulation

#### **3. State Management Best Practices**
```javascript
// Initialize nested objects safely
if (!assessmentData.controlMappings) assessmentData.controlMappings = {};
if (!assessmentData.coverageAllocations) assessmentData.coverageAllocations = {};
```
- **Session persistence** critical for user experience
- **Nested object initialization** prevents undefined errors
- **Save on every user action** to prevent data loss
- **Complex state structures** require careful initialization

#### **4. Enhanced Search Implementation**
```javascript
// Debounced search with defensive programming
clearTimeout(searchTimeout);
searchTimeout = setTimeout(() => {
    const filters = getActiveFilters();
    performControlSearch(searchTerm, filters, riskId, linkedControlIds, selectedControls);
}, 300);
```
- **Debouncing essential** for performance with large datasets
- **Multi-field search logic** requires careful filter combining
- **Modal state management** needs global variable handling
- **Search highlighting** requires proper regex escaping

#### **5. CSS Grid vs Table Selectors**
```css
/* OLD - Table-based selectors (breaks) */
.risk-matrix td.selected

/* NEW - CSS Grid selectors (works) */
.heat-map-cell.selected
```
- **Modern CSS grid** requires updated selectors
- **Selection clearing** must target correct elements
- **Responsive design** benefits from CSS grid over tables

#### **6. Large File Management**
- **File Size Warning:** Main wizard file is 4200+ lines
- **Use search_replace** for large files instead of edit_file
- **Modular function organization** helps manage complexity
- **Defensive error handling** more critical in large codebases

#### **7. Phase 4 Rebuild Lessons**
```javascript
// ISSUE: Complex nested data structure caused display failures
assessmentData.riskControlEffectiveness[`${riskId}-${controlId}`] = {...}

// SOLUTION: Simplified data structure for rebuild
assessmentData.controlEffectiveness = {
  riskId: {
    controlId: { design: 'effective', operational: 'partially', ... }
  }
}
```
- **Simplicity Over Complexity:** Start with basic working version
- **Incremental Enhancement:** Add features after core functionality works
- **Data Structure Validation:** Test data flow before UI implementation
- **Fallback Content:** Always show informative messages when data missing

## 🐛 **Common Issues & Solutions**

### **1. CSS 404 Errors**
**Symptom:** Dashboard styling disappears
**Solution:** Ensure `<link rel="stylesheet" href="rcsa-styles.css">` exists in head

### **2. Breadcrumb Update Failures**
**Symptom:** Navigation works but breadcrumb doesn't update
**Solution:** Wrap updateProgress() in try-catch with fallback

### **3. Risk Matrix Selection Issues**
**Symptom:** Previous selections don't clear
**Solution:** Update selectors to target `.heat-map-cell` not table cells

### **4. Control Search Modal State**
**Symptom:** Search selections don't persist or modal errors
**Solution:** Use global variables for modal state, defensive initialization

### **5. Large File Edit Issues**
**Symptom:** edit_file fails on files >4000 lines
**Solution:** Use search_replace for large files, break into smaller edits
