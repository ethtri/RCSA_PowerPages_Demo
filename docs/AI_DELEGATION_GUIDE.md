# AI Delegation Guide for RCSA Power Pages V3
## Essential Information for AI Assistants

### 🎯 Project Overview

**Client**: First Citizens Bank (US mid-tier bank)  
**Presenter**: CapTech Ventures  
**Platform**: Microsoft Power Pages (Desktop-only)  
**Timeline**: MVP proof of concept  
**Current Status**: Dashboard and Process Selection pages complete with full Dataverse integration

### 🏆 Success Metrics & Business Goals

**Primary Objective**: Reduce risk assessment time from 2+ hours to <10 minutes  
**User Adoption Target**: >80% voluntary usage  
**Cost Reduction**: 90% less than traditional GRC suites  
**Visibility**: Real-time risk dashboards vs quarterly reporting  

### 👥 Key User Personas

1. **Risk Manager (Primary User)**
   - VP Operations level, medium tech comfort
   - Completes 3-5 assessments monthly
   - Needs guidance and speed
   - Success = <10 minute assessments

2. **ERM Reviewer (Secondary User)**  
   - SVP Enterprise Risk Management
   - High tech comfort, power user
   - Reviews and challenges assessments
   - Success = consistent quality control

3. **Chief Risk Officer (Executive User)**
   - Board-level reporting responsibility
   - Low tech comfort, needs simplicity
   - Success = real-time insights and predictive analytics

### 🎨 Design & UX Standards

**CRITICAL**: Follow CapTech design system documented in `rcsa-ux-design-system.md`

**Key Design Principles**:
- **Primary Color**: #0066CC (CapTech blue) - use for CTAs, links, primary actions
- **Typography**: Segoe UI font family, specific size scale documented
- **Spacing**: 8px base unit system (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, 48px, 64px)
- **Cards**: White background, 1px #E5E5E5 border, 8px border-radius, 24px padding
- **Professional but not boring** - banking requires trust and clarity

**UX HIERARCHY LEARNINGS**:
- **Focus on actionable content** - Remove analytical views from main dashboard
- **Consistent section headers** - Use same typography scale across all sections
- **Avoid content overload** - Risk heat maps belong on reporting pages, not main dashboard
- **Single-column layouts** - Often cleaner than multi-column for task-focused interfaces
- **Remove redundant AI insights** - Don't duplicate information across sections

**Status Color System**:
- Green (#0D7F3F): Success, low risk, completion
- Amber (#CC6600): Medium risk, warnings, attention needed  
- Red (#CC0000): High risk, errors, urgent action
- Blue (#0066CC): Primary actions, information

### 🔧 Technical Architecture

**Environment**: https://rcsa-demo.powerappsportals.com/  
**Website ID**: 52650c85-abe4-4567-b374-8820e2117916 (RCSA CopIlot Demo - RCSA-Demo)  
**CLI Requirements**: `pac paportal upload --path "rcsa-demo-site/rcsa-copilot-demo---rcsa-demo" --modelVersion 2`

**DEVELOPMENT APPROACH**:
- **Frontend-First**: No backend data integrations for demo phase
- **Hard-coded Data**: Realistic banking demo data in JavaScript
- **Session Storage**: Workflow state management
- **Pure Frontend**: Rapid iteration and impressive demos

**JAVASCRIPT & WEB FILES**:
- **Embed JavaScript directly in HTML** - Web file uploads can fail due to GUID/validation issues
- **Use inline `<script>` tags** - More reliable than separate .js web files
- **CSS can be separate** - Web file uploads work better for CSS than JavaScript
- **Test uploads thoroughly** - Power Pages web file validation can be strict

**CRITICAL Authentication Pattern**:
- Use `user.contactid` (NOT `user.systemuserid`)
- Contact table enhanced with: `cr129_userrole`, `cr129_businessunitname`, `cr129_accesslevel`
- Role values: Analyst=100000000, Manager=100000001, Executive=100000002

### 📊 Data Integration Patterns

**MUST READ**: Complete patterns documented in `DATAVERSE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md`

**Key Patterns**:
1. **Choice Fields**: Use `.value` for comparison, `.label` for display
2. **Role-Based Filtering**: Analysts see own records, Managers see business unit records
3. **FetchXML Structure**: Always include primary key + display fields + lookup fields + audit fields
4. **DateTime Formatting**: Use `| date: "M/d/yyyy"` format
5. **Debug Panels**: Always include comprehensive debugging during development

**Critical Tables**:
- `cr129_assess`: Assessment records with Contact-based filtering
- `cr129_proc`: Process records with ownership and business unit display  
- `cr129_risk`: Risk records for AI suggestions and user selection
- `cr129_control`: Control records for mapping to risks
- `cr129_riskctrl`: Junction table linking risks to controls

### 🤖 AI Integration Requirements

**OpenAI Connector**: Integration for risk suggestions (currently needs fixing)  
**AI Behavior Patterns**:
- Critical processes → Suggest high risks (L:4-5, I:4-5)
- High processes → Suggest medium-high risks (L:3-4, I:3-4)  
- Medium/Low processes → Suggest medium risks (L:2-3, I:2-3)
- Always suggest 3 risks initially
- Allow users to Accept, Modify, or Reject suggestions

### 🔄 Workflow & Page Flow

**Completed Pages**:
1. ✅ **Dashboard** - Simplified, action-focused interface with metrics, priority tasks, and assessments
   - Removed: Risk heat map, redundant AI insights, Recent Activity
   - Added: Clean single-column layout, consistent typography, Performance Overview

**Remaining Pages** (In Priority Order):
2. 🚧 **Assessment Wizard** - Multi-step process for risk assessments
